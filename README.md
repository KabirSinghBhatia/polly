<h1> 💎 What is Polly Me about? </h1>

Polly Me is an app open for all and developed as part of the CSC 510 Software Engineering Project 1. Want to get the opinion of many people on a certain matter, but haven't found a device that supports a large number of users yet? Then Polly Me is the right place for you. This app enables the creation of robust polls that support the use of a large number of users. Each host can create their own virtual room where they can publish their questions and share them with a large number of people. With pre-built survey templates, different survey types can be created and the results can be viewed by both host and player after answering the question.
