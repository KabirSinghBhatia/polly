|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... | 3| 
 but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 3| evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|3| evidence in GH|
| Number of commits: by different people| 3| evidence in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**| 2| evidence in GH|
|  issues are being  closed| 3| evidence in GH|
| DOI badge: exists | 3| evidence in GH|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |3 |evidence in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 2 | evidence in GH |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 3| doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3| 
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 3| video in GH |
| Use of version control tools| 3| Used Github
| Use of  style checkers | 3| config files in GH showing your config| es lint file in GH repo
| Use of code  formatters. | 3| config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config| Used Prettier in Visual studio code 
| Use of syntax checkers. | 3| config files in  GH showing this checker's config  | Used default Visual studio code syntax checker
| Use of code coverage | 2| config files in GH| Test cases exist for backend APIs
| other automated analysis tools| 3| config files in GH| Badges in GH for build passing/failing, languages used.
| test cases exist| 2 | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base| tests folder in backend 
| test cases are routinely executed| 2| e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something| 
| the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3| evidence in GH |
| issues are discussed before they are closed| 3 | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here| Most of the discussion were oral in zoom meetings or   in-person meetings|
| Chat channel: exists| 3| Used whatsapp, zoom , google meet platforms for collaboration
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| 0| if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3| evidence in GH |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3|  evidence in GH |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3|
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3|
|short release cycles | 3|(hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work| evidence in GH
