# Changes in project 3
## Enchancements:
 1) Adding success messages after each user polls the data sucessfully.
 2) Added a frequent users page that lists out most frequent users. A surveyer can send their poll to these users.
 3) Refactoerd the CreateNewQuestion page improving its readibility and ease-of-use in the process.
 4) The ContactUs was page was not there and so the button on the navigation bar was not working. So, we created one and linked it in the navigation menu.
 5) Created the login-page for the application and integrated it with rest of the application.
 6) Added Login frontend API to interact with backend. 
 7) Earlier they were using bar-charts to show voting-percentages. Now, we tried with pie-charts and donut charts and decided on using donut charts as they help visualize the proportions better.
## Bugs fixed:
 1) Question disappears if you take more time to poll: This bug is fixed now. User gets enough time to poll.
 2) Menu bar was not working as intended due to broken links. We fixed that.
